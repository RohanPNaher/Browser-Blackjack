The basic rules of blackjack are [here](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/). 

In order to play, first click on a button that will set the total amount of rounds that you must win.
From there, you will be brought to the play area where cards are dealt to you and the dealer automatically. Naturals, Busts, and soft 21s are handled in the logic.

So far, there is no system where a player can split pairs.
